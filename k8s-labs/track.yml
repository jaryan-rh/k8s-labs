teaser: This is a lab where we will walk you through the installation and configuration
  of a single node kubernetes cluster.

  ## Background
  Vanilla Kubernetes can be intimidating. Everyone talks
  about its near mystical powers, but no one really talks about the work involved
  to setup a well run cluster. This hands-on course will provide an introduction to
  K8S, that can be run on your laptop. We'll walk through setting it up and some of
  the tasks you might want to consider implementing. In the afternoon, we will get
  some experience with OpenShift which is Red Hat's Kubernetes distribution. We'll
  compare and contrast using an opinionated Kubernetes distribution versus a vanilla
  Kubernetes installation and give you some food for thought as you are making the
  decision of which flavor to invest in.
